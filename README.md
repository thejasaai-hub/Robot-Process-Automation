# Robot Process Automation

## About RPA:

RPA is probably the fastest path to digital transformation and one of the most efficient and effective. 
RPA, or Robotic Process Automation, is the technology that enables computer software to emulate and integrate 
actions typically performed by humans interacting with digital systems. RPA robots can capture data, 
run applications, trigger responses, make decisions based on predefined rules, and communicate with other systems. 
RPA primarily targets processes that are highly manual, repetitive, and rule-based, with low exception rates and 
standard electronic readable input. RPA solutions can be thought of as virtual robotic workforces, whose operational 
management is made by the business line (only supported by IT), just like for a human workforce.

## The first automation mindset:

In the Automation First Era, you need to constantly look at your work and the processes in your company through 
the lens of automation potential. This is what we call the Automation First mindset. Adopting an “automation first” 
mindset is the first step on the path to making digital transformation real in the enterprise. Thinking automation 
first enables your company to move faster and more effectively. It helps you serve customers better. It enables you 
to operate more efficiently. It unburdens your employees from mundane, repetitive work, allowing them to focus on 
solving problems and creating value.

## UiPath platform:

The UiPath Platform offers you the components you need to design and develop automation projects, execute the 
instructions automatically, and manage your robot workforce. The components of the UiPath Platform are Studio (the workflow designer), 
Orchestrator (the robot management platform) and the Robot (the agent executing the instructions).

## UiPath Studio:

Helps you design automation workflows visually, quickly, and with only basic programming knowledge. Studio is where 
the automated processes are built visually, using the built-in recorder, drag & drop activities, and best practice templates.

## UiPath Orchestrator:

It lets you control, manage and monitor the robots. It is also the place where libraries, reusable components, assets 
and processes used by the robots are stored. Orchestrator is a server application accessed via a browser, through which 
the robotic workforce is controlled, managed, and monitored:

- The connections with the robots are created and maintained, and the robots are grouped (controlled)
- The automated processes are distributed as tasks to the robots (management)
- The execution of tasks is logged and kept track of (monitoring)

## The Robot:

Executes the workflows and instructions sent locally or via Orchestrator. There are two types of robots:
- Attended – is triggered by user events, and operates alongside a human, on the same workstation
- Unattended - runs unattended in virtual environments and can automate any number of processes.


This project contains a series of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) files designed using UiPath to automate 
a variety of tasks. These tasks showcase the power and versatility of RPA in automating repetitive processes. 
The files can be used as templates to automate workflows in UiPath Studio.

## RPA Tasks:

### 1.Welcome Message:
Automates the activity of displaying a welcome message using a message box in UiPath.

### 2.Opening a Browser:
Automates the opening of a browser application using UiPath, useful for automating web-based processes.

### 3.Copying Data from Browser to Notepad:
Automates the process of copying data from a browser and pasting it into a Notepad application.

### 4.Arithmetic Operations using UiPath:
Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers using UiPath.

### 5.Identifying Odd or Even Numbers in UiPath:
Automates the process of checking whether a number is odd or even using UiPath.

### 6.Recording for Notepad Automation:
Utilizes the Recording feature in UiPath to automate the Notepad application for a specific task.

### 7.Data Scraping in UiPath Studio:
Automates the data scraping process from web pages or applications into structured data that can be used in other applications.

### 8.Email Automation in UiPath:
Automates the process of sending emails using UiPath, including the handling of email attachments and body content.

### 10.Data Exporting from Excel to Google Form:
Automates the process of exporting data from an Excel file to a Google Form for further processing or collection.

## RPA Files:

All the **basic RPA files** for the tasks above are attached in this repository. They are available in the `/rpa_files` folder.
