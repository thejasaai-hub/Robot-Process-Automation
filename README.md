About RPA:
RPA is probably the fastest path to digital transformation and one of the most efficient and effective. RPA, or Robotic Process Automation, is the technology that enables computer software to emulate and integrate actions typically performed by humans interacting with digital systems. RPA robots are able to capture data, run applications, trigger responses, take decisions based on predefined rules and communicate with other systems. RPA primarily targets processes which are highly manual, repetitive, rule-based, with low exceptions rate and standard electronic readable input. RPA solutions can be thought of as virtual robotic workforces, whose operational management is made by the business line (only supported by IT), just like for a human workforce.
